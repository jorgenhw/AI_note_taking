-Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that combines cognitive science and neuroscience.
-The aim of cognitive neuroscience is to understand how cognition works and why it is the way it is.
-Cells are the fundamental units of life and are made up of proteins.
-Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
-Essential amino acids cannot be produced by cells and must be obtained from the environment.
-Essential amino acids are involved in complex cognitive functions and can make neurotransmitters.
-Homeostasis is the goal of cells and organisms to maintain balance and prevent decay.
-Cells have a membrane that acts as a barrier and allows for different concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell.
-Neurons are the main information processing devices of the brain.
-Neurons communicate through action potentials and synapses.
-Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses.
-Ion channels in the post-synaptic neuron respond to neurotransmitters and cause depolarization or hyperpolarization.
-Signal transmission can be modulated through various mechanisms.
-Astrocytes are cells in the brain that have many functions, including providing energy to neurons.
-Oligodendrocytes insulate axons and increase signal conduction speed.
-Pericytes regulate blood flow in the brain.
-The human brain has billions of neurons and complex structures.
-The cerebellum contains 80% of the neurons in the brain.
-The brain is incredibly complex and understanding it is a difficult task.
