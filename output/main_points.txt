- This is not a comprehensive overview of decision theory
- The focus will be on concrete tools for building decision models
- Decision models should be anchored in theory
- There are many relevant theories in decision theory
- Some setbacks will be discussed
- The Iowa Champlain task and conditional cooperation game will be discussed
- Anchoring model building in a concrete case of decision making is a stepping stone for more general cognitive model building
- Some aspects of model building may not be fully understood at this stage
- The Chenology on how to construct models will be introduced
- Plate notation will be used to represent models
- A simple model for binary choice will be built
- The next classes will involve programming and testing the models
- The quality of decisions made by a model can be varied
- Flipping coins is an example of a simple decision-making method
- Posterior checks will be discussed at some point
- The word "WH" is important in Chenology
