The text is a transcript from a lecture on decision theory. The speaker explains that the focus of the lecture will be on concrete tools for building decision models. They acknowledge that not all relevant theory will be covered, but encourage students to explore specific areas of interest on their own. The lecture will include discussions on the Iowa Gambling Task and conditional cooperation games as examples of decision-making processes. The speaker mentions that some aspects of model building may be difficult to grasp initially, but assures the students that they will build upon this foundation in future courses. The lecture will introduce the methodology for constructing decision models and provide examples using binary choice between two objects. The goal is to eventually program and test these models. The speaker also mentions that decision models can be used to automate decision-making, but acknowledges that the quality of these decisions may not always be ideal. They mention flipping a coin as an example of a simple decision-making method. The speaker concludes by asking the students what they want from the lecture and encourages them to have the same goal in mind.
