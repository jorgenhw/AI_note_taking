 Okay, so, getting started. As I've hinted at already a few times, this is not going to be a comprehensive overview of decision theory. I gave you sort of the outset of where decision making sort of stems from historically academic speaking. But then what we will go to from now on is sort of take the coxide you want, or our coxide. Okay, and you'll be heavily anchored in this cognitive model building framework of understanding decision. Okay, cool. And so what we will have more focus on are these more concrete tools for actually building your own decision models. And I find that to be a much more rewarding way into this. The trick is then of course to anchor whatever models you want to do in theory. And there's no way you can cover all relevant theory in that regard. And that would be partly up to you if you want to dive into a certain subspace of decision theory to then sort of gather the relevant theory in that regard. And you can come to me, and you can come to Dr. Duffer Duff. Okay. And so therefore we'll try to work with a few setbacks. I'll bring up a few today. And then we will, as I already did that, the Iowa Champlain task and then this conditional co-operation game. Because that way I sort of have a really firm anchor for talking about particular aspects of decision making. Yeah. And the idea is that anchoring this in a concrete case of decision making, anchoring model building in a concrete case of decision making is sort of a stepping stone for more general cognitive model building that the new book Ricardo makes. Okay. So I think it's fair to say that there will be a few aspects of the model building that you may feel like you don't have a full grasp of. And that's intentional from our side, from my side, and that's okay at this stage, right? That's simply because this is the first course you have on this, and we will be building on that next season. Cool. What I'm going to be introducing today is the Chetanology on how to construct these models. And most of that goes along the Lee and Wachemacher's chapter, and that we saw at the end of the speaking. And that's why we'll also get into this plate notation, so the actual sort of notation for representing models. And that also goes along with the Lee and Wachemacher's picture. And we'll build a very, very simple model for binary choice between two objects. Okay. And so that's us sort of laying the groundwork for the classes, the two next rounds, or two next classes, where we will actually program or code these models and test them. Okay. All right. What do you guys want from Chetanology? You want anything? Can I make one that makes decisions for me? Yeah, I think you can. Yeah. Yes. Especially if the quality of those decisions doesn't have to be anything specific. Then we can definitely do that for this. Boundary, screw it, flipping the coin. Exactly. Yeah, definitely can do. Yeah. Flipping coins, that's good at that. And it actually will get to posterior checks at some point where it actually sort of... Come back to that. Yeah, cool. All right. There's one particular word, of course. It's one of the WH words that I'm looking for. That's at least what I want from it. And I want you guys to want the same. Boundary, you want it?
