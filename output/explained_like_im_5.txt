Okay, so the person is talking about decision theory, which is how we make choices. They are saying that they won't cover everything in decision theory, but they will focus on tools to help us make our own decision models. They mention a few examples of decision-making tasks they will talk about. They also mention that they will introduce a methodology for building these models. They say that some parts might be a little hard to understand, but that's okay because we can learn more in the future. They also mention a specific type of notation that we will learn to represent the models. They explain that they will start with a simple model for making choices between two things, and in the next classes, we will learn how to code and test these models. Then they ask if we want anything from this topic, and someone says they want a model that can make decisions for them, like flipping a coin. The person says that we can do that, especially if the decisions don't have to be specific or important. They mention that we will also learn about something called posterior checks. Someone asks what they want from this topic, but I'm not sure what they mean by that.
